# Metastructure

Metastructure is a command-line tool that can generate & manage a complex Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) infrastructure, DevOps pipeline, etc., with a single YAML config file and a handful of Handlebars templates.

Metastructure works great right now, but the documentation is thin and the real magic is in setting up the templates for a model infrastructure. I'm working on that now, so feel free to track my progress at [this repo](https://github.com/karmaniverous/aws-metastructure).

Stay tuned for WAY more documentation!
