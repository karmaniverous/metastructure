> **_Where other tools use special syntax & structure to ENCAPSULATE Terraform code, Metastructure uses a powerful template engine to GENERATE Terraform code._**

## Welcome to Metastructure!

**Metastructure** is a command-line tool that works in conjunction with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and all the other things to generate & manage a complex AWS infrastructure.

With **Metastructure** you can...

- **_Write a true global configuration._** Manage your entire enterprise from a single YAML file.

- **_Actually use SSO in Terraform._** Zero credentials management, ever.

- **_Integrate all the things._** Your configuration goes where Terraform can't.

- **_DRY up your code base._** Because close doesn't count.

**Metastructure** leverages the tools you already use to do the things you already do... just faster, smaller, and safer.
